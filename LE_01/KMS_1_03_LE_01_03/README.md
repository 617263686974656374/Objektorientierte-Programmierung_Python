This program is a banking application that allows users to manage bank accounts via a console interface.
Users can check if they have an account, create a new account, deposit or withdraw money, view their account balance, 
and delete their account. The program stores account information in a CSV file and reads from it to make changes.
It includes error handling for non-existent accounts and invalid inputs. 
Additionally, there's a hidden admin option to display all accounts and a humorous error message for unexpected inputs.
