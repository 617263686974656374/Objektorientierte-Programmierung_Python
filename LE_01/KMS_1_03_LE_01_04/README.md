This program is a music library management system that allows users to manage albums and their associated songs. 
Users can add new albums, add songs to existing albums, remove songs, remove entire albums, and view all albums
and songs in the library. The music library's data is stored in a JSON file, and the program can load this data on startup and 
save any changes when the user exits. The interface is command-line based, with a main menu that guides the user through the available actions.
