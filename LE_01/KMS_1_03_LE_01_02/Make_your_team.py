#The program is a sports team management system. It allows creating `Player` 
#objects with names and `Team` objects with a name and a list of players. 
#Features include displaying all teams and their players, removing a specific 
#player from a team, and removing an entire team from the system. 
#The user interacts with the system through a console-based menu that allows 
#them to perform these actions. Input is required from the user to specify 
#the number of teams, the names of the teams, and the names of the players on each team. 
#The loop continues to prompt the user for actions until they choose to exit the program.
