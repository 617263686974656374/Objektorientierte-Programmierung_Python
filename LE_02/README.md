This program is a personnel management system that allows for adding, editing, filtering, and deleting customer and employee records.
It operates through a command-line interface, where users interact with the system via a menu that offers options to add new customers or employees, 
filter existing records based on a search operator, edit or delete specific entries, and display all records. 
The system supports saving and loading the data to and from a file, ensuring that records are persistent between sessions. 
The program's functionality is modularized across different files,
where each file contains specific functions or classes related to adding, filtering, editing, and managing people.
